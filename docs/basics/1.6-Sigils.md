# ðŸ“˜ Elixir Sigils Cheatsheet

### 1. `~s` vs `~S` (strings)

* `~s` â†’ supports escapes + interpolation.
* `~S` â†’ literal string, no escapes, no interpolation.

```elixir
x = "world"
~s(hello\n#{x})  # => "hello\nworld"  (newline + interpolation)
~S(hello\n#{x})  # => "hello\\n#{x}" (literal backslash-n + #{x})
```

---

### 2. `~w` vs `~W` (word lists)

* `~w` â†’ list of words, escapes + interpolation allowed.
* `~W` â†’ literal list, no escapes, no interpolation.

```elixir
x = "world"
~w(one two\n#{x}) # => ["one", "two\n", "world"]
~W(one two\n#{x}) # => ["one", "two\\n#{x}"]
```

---

### 3. `~r` vs `~R` (regex)

* `~r` â†’ regex with escapes + interpolation.
* `~R` â†’ regex literal, no escapes, no interpolation.

```elixir
x = "abc"
~r/foo#{x}/     # matches "fooabc"
~R/foo#{x}/     # matches literally "foo#{x}"
```

---

### 4. Other common ones

* `~c` / `~C` â†’ charlists (`'abc'` style).
* `~D` â†’ date (`~D[2025-08-23]`).
* `~T` â†’ time.
* `~N` â†’ naive datetime.
* `~U` â†’ UTC datetime.

---

# ðŸŽ¯ Interview Questions

1. **Whatâ€™s the difference between lowercase and uppercase sigils (e.g. `~s` vs `~S`)?**

   * Lowercase â†’ escapes + interpolation.
   * Uppercase â†’ literal (no escapes, no interpolation).

2. **When would you use `~w` vs `~W`?**

   * `~w` â†’ when you want a dynamic word list with escapes/interpolation.
   * `~W` â†’ when you want a static, literal word list.

3. **How does `~r` handle interpolation?**

   * `~r` allows interpolation inside regex.
   * `~R` disables interpolation and escapes.

4. **What is the output of `~s(hello\n)` vs `~S(hello\n)`?**

   * `~s(hello\n)` â†’ `"hello\n"` (string with newline).
   * `~S(hello\n)` â†’ `"hello\\n"` (literal `\n`).

5. **Can you define your own sigils?**

   * Yes, using `def sigil_x` functions.

### 1. **Strings**

* `~s` â†’ String **with** escaping/interpolation

  ```elixir
  x = "world"
  ~s(hello\n#{x})   # => "hello\nworld"
  IO.puts(~s(hello\n#{x}))  # prints with newline
  ```
* `~S` â†’ String **without** escaping/interpolation

  ```elixir
  x = "world"
  ~S(hello\n#{x})   # => "hello\\n\#{x}" (literally, no newline, no interpolation)
  ```

âœ… Use case: Choose `~s` when you need interpolation/escape chars, `~S` for raw literals (like regex patterns in string form).

---

### **Use case of sigils as a whole in Elixir**

Sigils are just *shortcuts* for creating different kinds of literals without writing verbose code.

Instead of writing long function calls or string manipulations, you use sigils for:

1. **Strings** â†’ easily handle escaping and interpolation.
2. **Regex** â†’ clean way to define regular expressions.
3. **Lists** â†’ quickly define lists of words or characters.
4. **Date/Time** â†’ clean syntax for `NaiveDateTime` / `DateTime`.
5. **Custom DSLs** â†’ you can define your own sigils (`defsigil`) for things like queries, templates, domain-specific strings.

---

### **Why they exist?**

* To **avoid clutter** (eg. regex with many `\\` backslashes).
* To **make code readable** (eg. writing dates with `~N[2025-08-23 12:00:00]`).
* To **provide flexibility** (choose whether you want escaping + interpolation or not).

---

### **Interview question angle**

* **Q:** Why does Elixir have sigils?
  **A:** To provide a concise, readable syntax for literals like strings, regex, dates, lists, etc., while letting developers decide whether to allow escaping and interpolation.
* **Q:** Whatâ€™s the difference between `~s` and `~S`?
  **A:** `~s` allows escaping and interpolation, `~S` does not. Same applies to `~r`/`~R`, `~w`/`~W`, etc.
* **Q:** Can you define your own sigil?
  **A:** Yes, with `defsigil`, useful for DSLs or custom data types.

1. Difference between `~s` and `~S`?
   â†’ `~s` allows interpolation/escapes, `~S` treats content literally.

2. How does `~w` work?
   â†’ Splits words into a list. `~w(one two)` â†’ `["one", "two"]`.

3. When would you use `~R` over `~r`?
   â†’ When writing static regex with many backslashes, to avoid escape hell.

4. What is the difference between `~N` and `~U`?
   â†’ `~N` is timezone naive, `~U` is UTC datetime.

5. What is a charlist vs string in Elixir?
   â†’ String = binary (`"abc"`), charlist = list of codepoints (`'abc'`).

ðŸ‘‰ So think of sigils as **syntax sugar + readability tool**. Not mandatory, but super handy in real projects.
